Ragnar is a fork of the awesome [Bjorn](https://github.com/infinition/Bjorn) project — a Tamagotchi-like autonomous network scanning, vulnerability assessment, and offensive security tool. It runs on a **Raspberry Pi** with a 2.13-inch e-Paper HAT, as a **headless server** on Debian-based systems (AMD64/ARM/ARM64) with Ethernet-first connectivity, or on the **WiFi Pineapple Pager** with full-color LCD display. On servers with 8GB+ RAM, Ragnar unlocks advanced capabilities including real-time traffic analysis and enhanced vulnerability scanning.

## Quick Install

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PierreGode/Ragnar/main/install_ragnar.sh
sudo chmod +x install_ragnar.sh && sudo ./install_ragnar.sh
# On Raspberry Pi: choose between e-Paper HAT, server/headless, or Pineapple Pager deployment.
# On other hardware: choose between server install or Pineapple Pager deployment.
# It may take a while as many packages and modules will be installed. Reboot when it finishes.
```

For detailed information see the [Install Guide](docs/INSTALL.md). See [Release Notes](RELEASE_NOTES.md) for what's new.

## 🌐 Web Interface

Access Ragnar's dashboard at `http://<ragnar-ip>:8000`

- Real-time network discovery and vulnerability scanning
- Multi-source threat intelligence dashboard
- File management with image gallery
- System monitoring and configuration
- Hardware profile auto-detection (Pi Zero 2W, Pi 4, Pi 5)

**WiFi Configuration Portal** — When Ragnar can't connect to a known network, it creates a WiFi hotspot:
1. Connect to WiFi network `Ragnar` (password: `ragnarconnect`)
2. Navigate to `http://192.168.4.1:8000`
3. Configure your WiFi credentials via the mobile-friendly interface
4. Ragnar will automatically retry known WiFi after some time if the AP is unused
5. Once configured, Ragnar exits AP mode and connects to your network

The portal supports network scanning with signal strength, manual entry for hidden SSIDs, known network management, and one-tap reconnection.

## 🐝 Ragnar + Pwnagotchi Side by Side

A bundled helper script plus dashboard controls make swapping between Ragnar and Pwnagotchi painless:

1. Run the installer:
   ```bash
   cd /home/ragnar/Ragnar
   sudo ./scripts/install_pwnagotchi.sh
   ```
   The script clones [pwnagotchiworking](https://github.com/PierreGode/pwnagotchiworking) into `/opt/pwnagotchi`, installs dependencies, writes `/etc/pwnagotchi/config.toml`, and drops a disabled `pwnagotchi.service`. Re-running is fast — it skips already-installed packages.

2. Open the web UI → **Config** tab → **Pwnagotchi Bridge** → click **Switch to Pwnagotchi**.

**Requirements:**
- USB WiFi adapter (wlan1) with monitor mode support
- Waveshare 2.13" e-Paper HAT V4 for the pwnagotchi face display

**Pwnagotchi web UI:** `http://<same-ip>:8080` (credentials: `ragnar` / `ragnar`)

**What the installer configures:**
- Monitor mode scripts (`/usr/bin/monstart`, `/usr/bin/monstop`)
- e-Paper display type (`waveshare213_v4`) and rotation
- Web UI on port 8080, Pwngrid disabled
- RSA keys, log directories, bettercap integration

**Swapping via PiSugar 3 button:**

| Button Action | While Ragnar is running | While Pwnagotchi is running |
|---------------|------------------------|---------------------------|
| Single tap | Toggle manual mode | — |
| Double tap | Switch to Pwnagotchi | Switch to Ragnar |
| Long press | Switch to Pwnagotchi | Switch to Ragnar |

A 10-second cooldown prevents accidental double triggers. If PiSugar is not connected, the listener is silently disabled.

**Static IP recommended:** When switching modes, WiFi may briefly reconnect with a different DHCP IP. Set a static IP:

```bash
sudo nmcli con mod "YOUR_WIFI_SSID" ipv4.method manual \
  ipv4.addresses "192.168.1.211/24" \
  ipv4.gateway "192.168.1.1" \
  ipv4.dns "192.168.1.1"
sudo nmcli con up "YOUR_WIFI_SSID"
```

Or set a DHCP reservation on your router. This only affects wlan0 — the monitor interface (wlan1/mon0) is not changed.

**Service recovery:** If Ragnar doesn't start after a reboot:
```bash
sudo /home/ragnar/Ragnar/scripts/fix_services.sh
```
